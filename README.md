# Password-Saver
This is a python project I created. The program allows you to enter an account name and password. A text file is created called "passwords.txt" that saves the accounts and passwords. You can add new information at any time or view all of the existing information inside of the text file.

What I learnt:
- Text files in python
- Functions in python
- List splitting in python
